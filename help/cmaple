Description

* Maple has the ability to algebraically manipulate unbounded integers, exact rational numbers, real numbers (with arbitrary
  precision), symbolic formulas, polynomials, sets, lists, equations, arrays, vectors, and matrices. It can solve systems of
  equations and differentiate and integrate expressions.

Examples

* In the following examples, the Maple output is displayed below the corresponding input expressions.

> p := x^2 - x - 2;

                                                              2
                                                        p := x  - x - 2

> q := (x+1) ^ 2;

                                                                     2
                                                         q := (x + 1)

> s := p/q;

                                                              2
                                                             x  - x - 2

                                                              (x + 1)

  Differentiate with respect to x.

> normal(s);

                                                             x - 2

Maple Interfaces

* The name of the command that invokes Maple depends on your operating system and chosen interface, worksheet (graphical user
  interface) or command line (character-based interface).

* Maple's worksheet interface is known as the Standard Worksheet interface.

  In Linux, use the maple command to start the Command-line version (that is, UNIX shell interface) or the xmaple command to
  start the Standard Worksheet version (X Windows).

  In Windows, use the cmaple command to start the Command-line version (that is, DOS console mode), the maplew command to start
  the Standard Worksheet version. The Standard Worksheet version is set up as an icon on your desktop during Maple
  installation.  You can also access it from the Start menu.

  On macOS, use the maple command to start the Command-line version or the xmaple command to start the Standard Worksheet
  version.

* In Maple, expressions are entered and read from an input region. To display results in an output region, press the Enter
  key while the cursor is in the input region.

Options

-a assertLevel

* The -a (assertion) option tells Maple to check all assertions.  This is equivalent to specifying kernelopts(assertlevel=1)
  at the beginning of the session.

-A assertLevel

* The -A (Assertion level) option sets the degree of assertion checking. The -A option must be followed by the integer 0, 1,
  or 2. This is equivalent to specifying kernelopts(assertlevel=N), where N is 0, 1, or 2, at the beginning of the session.

-B libname

* The -B option tells Maple that the default system and toolbox libraries should be added to the 'libname' variable used to
  specify where Maple looks for code repositories.  By default -B is implicitly specified.  It is most commonly used in
  addition to -b to append to or rearrange the library search order.

-b libname

* The -b (library) option tells Maple that the following argument specifies the pathname of the directory that contains Maple
  libraries or the full path of the .lib or .mla file of a single Maple library. This initializes the Maple variable 'libname'.
  By default, 'libname' is initialized with the pathname of the main Maple library (for example, /usr/local/maple/lib). Some
  sites customize the maple shell script to redefine the library pathname. For example,

  maple -b /usr/public/waterloo/maple/lib $*

  More than one -b option can be specified. When several -b options are used, the first -b option overrides the default
  'libname' setting, and subsequent -b options are appended to 'libname', forming a Maple expression sequence of directory
  names.  The -B option can be used to avoid overriding Maple system and toolbox libraries.

-binary operatingSystemName

* On a machine whose operating system supports more than one runtime of Maple, the -binary option allows one to override the
  automatic platform detection and to specify the platform.

-c mapleCommand

* The -c (execute command) option specifies a command that Maple is to execute on startup. It is only valid for Command-line
  versions of Maple. The command can be any valid Maple command, but it cannot contain blank characters. Multiple -c options
  can be specified.  Commands specified by -c options, and files specified by -i options, are executed in the order in which
  they are specified, after the initialization files have been read. Note: These commands are also re-executed after a restart
  command. See restart.

-D macroDef

* The -D (Define) option is used to predefine a macro for the Maple preprocessor (see $define). The -D option can be followed
  by a symbol, or a symbol, equal sign, and the definition of the symbol. Multiple -D options can be used to define multiple
  symbols.

-e errorBreak

* The -e (break on error) option tells Maple what to do when an error is encountered while reading a file. -e0 tells Maple to
  report the error and keep reading the file. -e1 (the default) tells Maple to stop reading the file (and to skip to the end)
  when a syntax error is encountered. Both -e2 and -e3 tell Maple to stop reading and to skip to the end when any type of error
  is encountered. In addition, -e3 will also print a Maple function stack trace after the error. This behavior can also be
  changed in Maple by using the command interface(errorbreak = n) where n is 0, 1, 2, or 3.

--echofile=echoFile

* The --echofile option instructs Maple to echo the current session (both input and output) to the specified file, in HTML
  format if the filename ends with ".htm" or ".html", or as plain text otherwise.

-F (no filter)

* The -F (no Filter) option prevents Maple from exiting when the standard input has been redirected from a file, and the end
  of the file is encountered. By default, Maple exits. If -F is specified, Maple instead continues interactively at that point.

-f licenseFile

* The -f (license file) option tells Maple to use the specified license file instead of the default one.

-h (help)

* The -h (help) option tells Maple to open the GUI help browser.

--historyfile=histFile

* The --historyfile option instructs Maple to use the specified file for persistent command-line history.  If the value
  "none" is given, then persistent history is disabled. The default history file is .maple_history in the user home directory.

--historysize=histSize

* The --historysize option instructs Maple to retain the specified number of lines of command-line history.

-I includePath

* The -I (Include) option specifies directories to be searched for files specified in $include directives. Multiple
  directories can be specified, separated by commas. Alternatively, multiple -I options can be used to specify multiple
  directories.

-i initFile

* The -i (initialization file) option specifies additional files to be read after the standard Maple initialization files. It
  is valid only for the Command-line interface. Multiple -i options can be specified. Files specified by -i options, and
  commands specified by -c options, are executed in the order in which they are specified, after the normal initialization
  files have been read. If security is enabled, files specified by -i are automatically added to the list of readable files.

--init-reserve-mem=memorysize

* The --init-reserve-mem option allows the size of the virtual memory map that Maple creates on start up to be specified.
  This is also the maximum amount of memory that the Maple session will be able to use.  By default Maple creates a map
  slightly smaller than the amount of physical memory available on the machine.  By using this option, that size can be
  changed.  By specifying an amount larger than that physical memory, Maple will use swap space if necessary.  If options --
  init-reserve-mem and -T are both given, then -T takes precedence.

--init-commit-mem=memorysize

* The --init-commit-mem option allows the size of the memory Maple allocates on start up to be specified.  This option can be
  used if Maple is executing a problem that is known to require a large amount of physical memory.  Instead of Maple growing
  its committed memory to that size, this option will force Maple to allocate the specified amount on start up.

-km p (parallel kernel mode)

* The -km p (or parallel kernel mode) option, which applies only to worksheet versions of Maple, is used to start Maple in
  the parallel server kernel mode. The parallel server mode enables each worksheet in a given Maple session to be independent
  of other worksheets. By default, the Standard GUI runs in parallel kernel mode.

-km q (query kernel mode)

* The -km q (or query (or mixed) kernel mode) option, which applies only to worksheet versions of Maple, is used to start
  Maple in the mixed server kernel mode. In the mixed server mode, for each worksheet in a Maple session, you can select
  whether it uses a (new) parallel kernel (that is, it is independent of other worksheets) or shares a kernel with one or more
  other worksheets.

-km s (single kernel mode)

* The -km s (or single kernel mode) option, which applies only to worksheet versions of Maple, is used to start Maple in the
  single server kernel mode. For example, if you assign a value to a variable in one worksheet, all other worksheets in the
  current session are affected by this new definition.

-L logFile

* The -L (Log file) option is used to create a log of all the library objects that are loaded in a Maple session. This is
  useful if you have developed a library of Maple routines, and want to determine which ones are actually used. As each object
  is loaded, its name is recorded in the specified log file. This file is not closed until the Maple session exits.

-l latexOption

* The -l (latex) option causes Maple to run in LaTeX filter mode. This is useful in the production of books using (or about)
  Maple. The -l option is specified by a suboption specific to LaTeX filter mode. Multiple -l options can be used to introduce
  multiple suboptions. For more details, see latex_filter.

-nocloud

* The -nocloud option starts Maple without the MapleCloud palette. When this option is set, it is not possible to receive
  documents shared using the MapleCloud Content Exchange. This option can only be used in the standard GUI interface.

-P (parse only)

* The -P (Parse only) option causes Maple to read input, but not evaluate any expressions. This can be used to quickly check
  a file of Maple commands for syntax errors, and should be used in conjunction with -e0 so that Maple does not stop when an
  error is encountered. It is also useful in conjunction with the Maple preprocessor (see $include) to preview the
  preprocessing operations without actual execution.

-q (quiet)

* The -q (quiet) option suppresses the printing of the Maple startup message, various informational messages (bytes used
  messages and garbage collection messages), and the signoff message. Maple is better suited for use as a filter when these
  messages are suppressed.

-s (suppress initialization)

* The -s (suppress initialization) option causes Maple to forgo reading initialization files when initiating a session.

--secure-read=file

* The --secure-read option adds the given file specification to the inclusion list for readable files.  For more details, see
  the EngineSecurity,CLIConfig help page.

--secure-noread=file

* The --secure-noread option adds the given file specification to the exclusion list for readable files.  For more details,
  see the EngineSecurity,CLIConfig help page.

--secure-write=file

* The --secure-write option adds the given file specification to the inclusion list for writable files.  For more details,
  see the EngineSecurity,CLIConfig help page.

--secure-nowrite=file

* The --secure-nowrite option adds the given file specification to the exclusion list for writable files.  For more details,
  see the EngineSecurity,CLIConfig help page.

--secure-extcall=file

* The --secure-extcall option adds the given file specification to the inclusion list for loadable external libraries.  For
  more details, see the EngineSecurity,CLIConfig help page.

--secure-noextcall=file

* The --secure-noextcall option adds the given file specification to the exclusion list for loadable external libraries.  For
  more details, see the EngineSecurity,CLIConfig help page.

--secure-readspec=file

* The --secure-readspec option instructs Maple to read specification for readable files from the given list.  For more
  details, see the EngineSecurity,CLIConfig help page.

--secure-writespec=file

* The --secure-writespec option instructs Maple to read specification for writable files from the given list.  For more
  details, see the EngineSecurity,CLIConfig help page.

--secure-extcallspec=file

* The --secure-extcallspec option instructs Maple to read specification for loadable external libraries from the given list.
  For more details, see the EngineSecurity,CLIConfig help page.

--secure-syscall=flag

* The --secure-syscall option enables (or disables -- according to the flag) calls to the system, if security is enabled.
  For more details, see the EngineSecurity,CLIConfig help page.

--secure-mode=flag

* The --secure-mode option enables (or disables -- according to the flag) security in Maple. For more details, see the
  EngineSecurity,CLIConfig help page.

--setsort=orderNumber

* The --setsort=orderNumber option changes the sort order for Maple sets.  Specifying --setsort=0 causes sets to be ordered
  by the addresses of the underlying data structures contained in the set as was the only ordering prior to Maple 12.  The
  current default --setsort=1 is based on a "nice" mix of the size, id, and value of the data structures contained in the set.
  Other values from --setsort=2 through --setsort=8 are variations of the default and can be used to purposefully introduce
  ordering differences into your code to test its robustness. This option can only be set at startup as different orderings
  cannot be mixed in the same session.  For more detail on the default ordering, see set.

--strip-debug-info

* The --strip-debug-info option removes any debugging (source file and line number) information stored in a procedure when
  reading from a source file or library archive, preventing source level debugging.  See debugger.

-T resourceLimit

* The -T (resource limiT) option is used to limit the amount of system resources that Maple can consume before execution is
  terminated. This option takes four parameters, separated by commas. The CPU time limit parameter specifies the maximum number
  of seconds of CPU time that the Maple process is to use. The data limit restricts the amount of memory, in kiloBytes, that
  Maple can use. The stack limit sets the maximum stack size, in kiloBytes. The core dump limit specifies the maximum size of
  core file that can be produced in the unlikely event of a core dump. You can specify any prefix of the four parameters, and
  omit the rest (for example, specify only the CPU and data limits).

-t (test mode)

* The -t (test mode) option causes Maple to change its configuration to one suitable for running the Maple test suite.
  Specifically, the prompt is changed to "#-->", prettyprinting is disabled, and all but the last "bytes used" messages are
  suppressed. The final "bytes used" message is printed to stderr. This option is not normally needed by Maple users.

-U undefineMacro

* The -U (Undefine) option is used to undefine a Maple preprocessor macro (see $undef) that was defined earlier on the
  command line by a -D option. The -U option must be followed by the symbol to undefine. Multiple -U options can be used to
  undefine multiple symbols.

-u (UNIX line endings)

* The -u (UNIX line endings) option forces non-UNIX versions of Maple to produce UNIX line endings on the standard output
  stream. This is generally only of use if you are using the Command-line version of Maple in conjunction with UNIX-like tools
  under Microsoft Windows.

-w warningLevel

* The -w (warning level) option specifies whether Maple should print certain warnings.  -w 0 turns off warnings. -w 1 enables
  library-generated warnings.  -w 2 enables library- and kernel-generated warnings.  -w 3 (the default) enables library-,
  kernel-, and parser-generated warnings.  -w 4 enables all warnings, that is library-, kernel-, parser-generated, and
  compatibility warnings.

-x (X Window)

* The -x option runs the Standard Worksheet X Window version on UNIX platforms and the Standard Worksheet version on
  Macintosh platforms, instead of the default Command-line version. The xmaple command is equivalent to the maple -x command.

-z (default security settings)

* The -z option starts Maple with the default security settings enabled.  For more details, see the EngineSecurity,CLIConfig
  help page.

* If a file is specified on the command line after the last option, that file is read by Maple. For the Command-line
  interface, the file must be a text file of valid Maple commands. For worksheet versions, the file must be a Maple worksheet
  file.

Return Values

* On exit, the Command-line version of Maple returns a return code to the operating system. When invoked from a UNIX or
  Windows shell script, this return code can be tested to determine why Maple exited. The possible return codes are:

* 0 - Maple exited normally, as a result of reaching the end of a Maple script if one was specified on the command line, or
  by executing a quit, done, or stop command.

* 1 - An error occurred during initialization, and Maple was unable to properly start up.

* 2 - A script specified on the command line (possibly by redirecting the standard input stream) ended prematurely. Usually
  this indicates a missing closing delimiter in the script, such as a parenthesis or an end keyword.

* 3 - After successfully reading a script specified on the command line, Maple failed to re-open the standard input stream
  for interactive input. This can happen only if the -F option was specified.

* 4 - While processing a script specified on the command line, an error was encountered. The severity of the error required
  to cause Maple to exit (instead of attempting to carry on) depends on the setting of interface(errorbreak). A setting of 1
  will stop only on syntax errors. A setting of 2 will stop on any error.

* 5 - The Maple kernel has unexpectedly terminated while executing a script or being used interactively.

* n - Any other return value can only occur if Maple executes a `quit`(n), `done`(n), or `stop`(n) function call, passing n
  as the desired return code. Typically (but depending on the underlying operating system and shell), any value in the range 0
  to 127 is permitted. It is a good idea to avoid values 1 through 5 since they already have predefined meanings as described
  above.

Initialization Files

* Any number of statements can be placed in the initialization files. The effect is identical to that of entering statements
  in a Maple session.  After all the statements in the initialization files are executed, the prompt appears and the Maple
  session begins.  It is recommended that all statements in the initialization files terminate with a colon (:) rather than a
  semicolon (;) to prevent any display.

* For information about initialization files on various operating systems, see the Create Maple Initialization File help
  page.

* Additional initialization files can be specified explicitly using the -i option as described earlier.

* The -s option suppresses the reading of all initialization files, including those specified by -i options.

System Environment Variables

* Under UNIX, Maple uses several system environment variables.  These are generally set by the maple script, so the user need
  not worry about them.

* The MAPLE variable specifies where to find the Maple library and help files, the help browser index, and various
  configuration files. If the MAPLE variable is undefined, Maple uses "/usr/local/maple" as the default.

* The HOME variable is used to identify where the user's .mapleinit file is located.

* The PATH variable is used to locate auxiliary programs, such as the plot driver.

For Help

* For help with Maple commands and features, the Maple help system is the most comprehensive reference. Enter ?help at the
  Maple prompt for more information.

* Graphical versions of Maple also have a thoroughly indexed and searchable help system, letting you quickly find help pages
  of interest. By setting interface(helpbrowser=standard):, it is possible to view documentation through the standard GUI help
  browser from any interface including command line.

* If you have a question that you think is of a very specific nature and not of interest to others, send a message to your
  site license technical administrator (if your site has a site license).

* If your site does not have a site license, visit http://www.maplesoft.com/support.
