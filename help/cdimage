Usage: CDIMAGE [options] sourceroot targetfile

       -l  volume label, no spaces (e.g. -lMYLABEL)
       -t  time stamp for all files and directories, no spaces, any delimiter
             (e.g. -t12/31/2000,15:01:00)
       -g  encode GMT time for files rather than local time
       -h  include hidden files and directories
       -n  allow long filenames (longer than DOS 8.3 names)
       -nt allow long filenames, restricted to NT 3.51 compatibility
             (-nt and -d cannot be used together)
       -d  don't force lowercase filenames to uppercase
       -c  use ANSI filenames versus OEM filenames from source
       -j1 encode Joliet Unicode filenames AND generate DOS-compatible 8.3
             filenames in the ISO-9660 name space (can be read by either
             Joliet systems or conventional ISO-9660 systems, but some of the
             filenames in the ISO-9660 name space might be changed to comply
             with DOS 8.3 and/or ISO-9660 naming restrictions)
       -j2 encode Joliet Unicode filenames without standard ISO-9660 names
             (requires a Joliet operating system to read files from the CD)
           When using the -j1 or -j2 options, the -n, -nt, and -d options
             do not apply and cannot be used.
       -js non-Joliet "readme.txt" file for images encoded with -j2 option
             (e.g. -jsc:\location\readme.txt). This file will be visible as
             the only file in the root directory of the disc on systems that
             do not support the Joliet format (Windows 3.1, NT 3.x, etc).
       -u1 encode "UDF-Bridge" media
       -u2 encode "UDF" file system without a mirror ISO-9660 file system
             (requires a UDF capable operating system to read the files)
       -ur non-UDF "readme.txt" file for images encoded with -u2 option
             (e.g. -usc:\location\readme.txt). This file will be visible as
             the only file in the root directory of the disc on systems that
             do not support the UDF format.
       -us sparse UDF files
       -ue embed file data in UDF extent entry
       -uf embed UDF FID entries
       -uv UDF Video Zone compatibility enforced
       -b  "El Torito" boot sector file, no spaces
             (e.g. -bc:\location\cdboot.bin)
       -p  Platform ID for the "El Torito" boot catalog
       -e  Do not set floppy emulation mode in El Torito boot catalog
       -s  sign image file with digital signature (no spaces, provide RPC
             server and endpoint name like -sServerName:EndPointName)
       -x  compute and encode "AutoCRC" values in image
       -o  optimize storage by encoding duplicate files only once
       -oc slower duplicate file detection using binary comparisons rather
             than MD5 hash values
       -oi ignore diamond compression timestamps when comparing files
       -os show duplicate files while creating image
           (-o options can be combined like -ocis)
       -w  warning level followed by number (e.g. -w4)
           1  report non-ISO or non-Joliet compliant filenames or depth
           2  report non-DOS compliant filenames
           3  report zero-length files
           4  report each file name copied to image
       -y  test option followed by number (e.g. -y1), used to generate
             non-standard variations of ISO-9660 for testing purposes:
           1 encode trailing version number ';1' on filenames (7.5.1)
           2 round directory sizes to multiples of 2K (6.8.1.3)
           5 write \i386 directory files first, in reverse sort order
           6 allow directory records to be exactly aligned at ends of sectors
               (ISO-9660 6.8.1.1 conformant but breaks MSCDEX)
           7 warn about generated shortnames for 16-bit apps under NT 4.0
           b blocksize 512 bytes rather than 2048 bytes
           d suppress warning for non-identical files with same initial 64K
           l UDF - long ads used in file entries instead of short ads
           r UDF - number of ad's is random
           w open source files with write sharing
           t load segment in hex for El Torito boot image (e.g. -yt7C0)
           f use a faster way to generate short names
       -k  (keep) create image even if fail to open some of the source files
       -m  ignore maximum image size of 681,984,000 bytes
       -a  allocation summary shows file and directory sizes
       -q  scan source files only, don't create an image file

       NOTE: Many of these options allow you to create CD images
             that are NOT compliant with ISO-9660 and may also
             NOT be compatibile with one or more operating systems.
             If you want strict ISO and DOS compliance, use the -w2
             warning level and correct any discrepencies reported.
             YOU are responsible for insuring that any generated CDs
             are compatible with all appropriate operating systems.
             Also note that Microsoft company information is placed
             in the image volume header, so don't use this program
             to generate CDs for companies other than Microsoft.
